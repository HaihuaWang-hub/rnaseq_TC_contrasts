# Steps for Camelina seed Time Course Experiment
## Remove Bad Samples from Count Data

Rscript --vanilla /home/grabowsky/tools/workflows/rnaseq_TC_contrasts/r_scripts/remove_bad_samp_counts.r
```
## DESeq2
### Overview
#### My Notes
Uses negative binomial generalized linear models and estimated dispersion and log-fold-changes for different parameters in the model
#### Explanation of Files Generated by Scripts
Returns 2 groups of 3 files:
##### Groups
..+`<general>`: genes that are different between the Control and Treatment after accounting for the other parameters, specifically, time. These genes "overall" differences and not necessarily different responses/reactions across time. Usually, this will be a large list.
..+`<TC>`: genes that show differences at different time points that are different from the "global" differences between Control and Treatment. For instance: Expression in Treatment line increases from T0 to T1 but is unchanged in Control line.
##### Files Within Groups
..+`<PREFIX_DESeq2_GROUP_genes.txt>`: contains all genes, overall p-value, and multiple testing-corrected p-value
..+`<PREFIX_DESeq2_TC_var_lfc.txt>`: (only for TC group) contains the estimated log-fold-change associated with each variable in the model (not including TimeVsTime variables). This can be used for trying to cluster genes based on their modeled response across conditions
..+`<PREFIX_DESeq2_GROUP_full_mat.txt>`: contains the gene name, average expression parameter values, average expression, F value, overall p-value, and multiple testing-adjusted p-value for the significant genes
